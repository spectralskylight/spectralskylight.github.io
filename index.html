            <tr><td colspan="4">We present spectal sky data, source code, and experimental results from the research project on sky dome spectral energy project that is currently being conducted by the SENSEable Design Lab at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, FL. This project started at the Program of Computer Graphics at Cornell University where the intial data was catpured. The results are presented in reverse chronological order, so that our SIGGRAPH ASIA 2014 paper that described the data capture process and intial tools is now on the bottom of the page. The dataset is provided in a single source that is continuously being expanded as new data is captured and cleaned for public use. We provide various open-source tools to allow researchers to view and use the data in their experiements. Please view our Github <a href="https://github.com/spectralskylight">spectralskylight</a> for all the code, data, and documentation we currently have aviable. Check this page from time to time to see whether there are any updates as we continue our research!</tr>
